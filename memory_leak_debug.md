If your Django API blocks memory even after completing its execution, the root cause could be related to resource leaks or inefficient memory management in your application. Manually restarting the server resolves the issue temporarily but isn’t an ideal solution. Here’s how you can address this problem effectively:


---

1. Debug Memory Usage

Use Python tools to analyze and profile memory usage:

tracemalloc: Tracks memory allocations.

objgraph: Helps identify memory leaks by showing reference chains.

Memory Profiler: Tracks memory consumption during execution.



Example Using tracemalloc:
```
import tracemalloc

tracemalloc.start()

# Your API logic here

snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
top_stats = snapshot.statistics('lineno')

print("[ Top 10 ]")
for stat in top_stats[:10]:
    print(stat)
```

Analyze this output to identify where excessive memory is allocated.

2. Ensure Cleanup of Resources

Some common culprits include:

1. Database Connections:

Ensure database connections are closed properly using Django’s ORM.

Example:

```
from django.db import connection
connection.close()
```


2. File Descriptors:

Close file objects or sockets explicitly.

Example:
```
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
# Do some processing
file.close()
```


3. Heavy Objects:

Delete large objects explicitly using del and force garbage collection.

Example:
```
import gc
del large_object
gc.collect()
```

3. Use Server Restart as a Last Resort

If debugging and optimizing don’t resolve the issue, you can integrate automatic server restarts into your workflow to clear memory.

Option A: Restart Development Server

Use os.execv as discussed earlier:
```
import os
import sys

def restart_server():
    python = sys.executable
    os.execl(python, python, *sys.argv)
```
Call this function after completing the API logic.


---

Option B: Use a Process Manager

For production-like environments:

Use supervisord or systemd to manage and restart the server.

Example with supervisord:

Define your Django server in the supervisord config:
```
[program:django]
command=python manage.py runserver 8080
autostart=true
autorestart=true
```
To restart:
```
supervisorctl restart django
```



---

5. Monitor Memory Usage

Use tools like htop, psutil, or Django middleware to monitor memory usage in real-time.

Add logging to track memory usage per request:
```
import psutil
import os

def log_memory_usage():
    process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
    print(f"Memory Usage: {process.memory_info().rss / 1024 ** 2} MB")
```


---

6. Garbage Collection

Force garbage collection after each API request if memory leaks are suspected:
```
import gc

def my_api_logic():
    # Your API logic
    gc.collect()  # Force garbage collection
```

---

7. Long-Term Solution

Profile your application regularly for memory inefficiencies.

Consider using a task queue like Celery for heavy background tasks instead of processing them synchronously in your API.

Other Solutions

1. if you want to start a new process and close previous one:

```
import os
import subprocess
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response

class RestartServerAPIView(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        response = {"message": "Server is restarting"}

        def restart_server():
            # Construct the restart command
            command = ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "8080"]

            # Spawn a new server process
            subprocess.Popen(command, close_fds=True)

            # Terminate the current process
            os._exit(0)  # Forcefully exit to release the port

        # Return response before restarting
        response = Response(response)
        restart_server()

        return response
```


```
import os
import sys
import subprocess
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response

class RestartServerAPIView(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        # Your API logic here
        response = {"message": "Server is restarting"}
        
        # Path to your manage.py file
        manage_py_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), '../../manage.py')

        # Restart server logic
        def restart_server():
            # Construct the restart command
            command = [sys.executable, manage_py_path, "runserver", "8080"]
            # Terminate the current process and start the server
            os.execv(sys.executable, command)
        
        # Return response before restarting
        response = Response(response)
        restart_server()
        
        return response  # This line will not execute after os.execv
```
